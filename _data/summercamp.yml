AboutTheCamp2:
  title2: More than Robots
  paragraph2: When most people think about robotics, they picture computer-controlled machines that are coded to complete certain tasks. While building and programming robots are a big part of what we do, our team provides many more opportunities outside of traditional technical fields. We have different subteams and groups that focus on other non-technical aspects, including art, public relations, and student leadership, to name a few. Through the different sessions offered, campers will be able to experience what makes our team more than just robotics. To learn more about the various sessions, check out the Sessions page.
  title3: Counselors
  paragraph3: Our team embraces and fosters a student-run philosophy, promoting student leadership as well as sustainability through having experienced veteran members pass down knowledge to younger students. Reflecting on this philosophy, our high school team members will be the counselors teaching campers and enriching their STEAM education. Just as we were mentored by older team members, we hope to be able to share what we have learned to the younger generation.

  info: In the Robot Design and Hardware session, campers will be given an engaging experience learning the fundamentals of prototyping, designing, and assembling through lessons and hands-on activities. Campers will also be working in groups to come up with solutions to game challenges inspired by FIRST Robotics Competitions. Counselors will assist campers throughout this process, maintaining hands-off mentorship to allow for creative ideas to thought-provoking problems.
  title1: Programming
  img1: /assets/img/summercamp/programming1.jpg
  info1: The Programming session seeks to ignite an interest in computer science through its applications in robotics. Campers will dive deep into the various aspects of software development and will develop the technical know-how to program in the Python programming language, focusing on its applications toward robotics. All levels of experience are encouraged to come, with a unique curriculum for new and advanced programmers.
  title2: Entrepreneurship and Website Design

  info2: The Entrepreneurship and Web Design session gives campers an overview of business-related dealings with a curriculum that covers how to develop and launch their own professional startup companies. Campers will continue to learn fundamentals skills such as marketing, advertising, and public-speaking while creating plans for finances and company growth. They will showcase their skills through a mock business proposal and creating a company website with HTML, CSS, and Git. This year we are revamping the culminating company pitch by inviting a panel of local business executives to hear the presentations and provide personal feedback to campers.
