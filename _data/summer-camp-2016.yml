    AboutTheCamp1:
        paragraph1: This year, Paly Robotics will be offering three different weeks of our annual summer camp for incoming middle school students (incoming 6th - 9th). We hope to spark interest and start future high school students on a path in science, technology, engineering, art or math (STEAM). If you have any questions, feel free to contact us at summercamp [at] palyrobotics [dot] com.

            title2: More than Robotics
            paragraph2: When most people think about robotics, they picture machines that are controlled by computers to complete certain tasks. While building and programming robots is a big part of what we do, our team is much more than that below the surface. We have different sections of the team that focus on things such as art, public relations, and student leadership, to name a few. Through the different sessions offered, campers will be able to experience what makes our team more than just robotics. To learn more about the sessions offered, check out the Sessions page.

            title2: Counselors
            paragraph2: Student mentoring is a big part of our team’s philosophy, and we rely on passing down knowledge from the older students to the younger students. Reflecting this philosophy, our high school team members will be teaching campers about STEAM through the different aspects of the robotics team. Just as we were taught by older team members, we hope to be able to teach what we have learned to the younger generation. 
    Sessions1:
            paragraph: We are currently waitlisting people for sessions that are full. If the waitlist is still open for a given session, please select that session during registration to be automatically added to its waitlist. If the waitlist is closed for a given session, we cannot add any more people to the waitlist for that session.

            img: /assets/img/summercamp/build-img.png
            info: In the Robot Design and Hardware session, campers will experience the process of hardware engineering, from the designing phase all the way to manufacturing and assembly. Campers will learn how to work with others and explain their ideas to create a useful and mechanically sound design to complete a specific challenge. Afterwards, trained counselors will assist campers in the use of tools to safely bring their design to fruition.

            title: Programming and 3D Animation
            img: /assets/img/summercamp/programming-img.png
            info: In the Programming and 3D Animation session, campers will work in Python to learn the basics of programming. There will be an introductory programming group for those without experience, as well as an advanced group for those who are already familiar with software. Additionally, campers will learn to make and animate 3D models using Autodesk Maya, a professional piece of software used by some of the biggest animation companies, including Pixar. By the end of the camp, campers will have created final projects which they will be able to bring home.

            title: Entrepreneurship and Website Design
            img: /assets/img/summercamp/design-img.png
            info: In the Entrepreneurship and Web Design session, campers will learn how to take a business idea from start to finish; learning the skills to pitch their business ideas to potential investors. Furthermore, campers will learn how to create websites with languages such as HTML and CSS to showcase their business ideas, using GitHub to keep track of changes in a group environment.
   FAQ: 
        -
            question: Is previous experience required?
            answer: Not at all. We hope to introduce all campers to STEAM regardless of what they already know. If they have previous experience, that is totally fine, and we will be sure to keep them engaged with interesting activities.
        -
            question: I'm confused, how does registration work?
            answer: Don't worry, it can be confusing. We are offering the camp three different weeks, and each week, there are two different sessions to choose from. For example, a camper could choose to register for two weeks of camp. They could pick the Robot Design and Hardware session the first week, and the Entrepreneurship and Website Design session the second week.

            question: What if a session is full?
            answer: We are currently waitlisting people for sessions that are full. If the waitlist is still open for a given session, please select that session during registration to be automatically added to its waitlist. If the waitlist is closed for a given session, we cannot add any more people to the waitlist for that session.
