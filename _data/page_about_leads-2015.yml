  email: lbrownell [at] palyrobotics [dot] com
  bio: Lydia Brownell is a junior and has been on the team about two years. She began as a build team member, and still actively participates in the build team, but has expanded into the newly created role of design captain. She loves being on Team 8 because she has built model cars and planes since she was 8 years old and tinkered with legos even earlier than that; robotics is the next step. Robotics has also taught her very useful leadership skills, as well as given her many awesome friends who also care just as much about robotics and the traditions of Paly Robotics. Outside of Robotics, Lydia loves to read, build and draw miniature models, and hang out with her friends and family.

He now serves as the Art Captain and Animation Lead, and helps out with a handful of additional projects. When he absolutely can't be in the lab (i.e. when the coach makes everyone go home), he.s probably on Slack or tinkering with several small art/computer science/engineering projects that are in various stages of completion.

  bio: Alex joined the robotics team in his freshman year, looking to join programming team along with his friend, Rafi. It was there that they encountered Max Bernstein, the webmaster, who invited them to join web team. Max eventually graduated, and Rafi became the next web captain. Alex moved on to join the programming team as he originally intended. However, Rafi left the team to join Team 6036, leaving Alex, the only person left on the team knowledgable enough about web, to take over his position as web captain. He is now working to tie together all the loose ends and trying to seal the hole Rafi left in the team.

  role: Treasurer

  name: Madeline Li
  email: mli [at] palyrobotics [dot] com
  bio: The treasurer joined Paly Robotics her freshman year, during the middle of build season. As she was swept into the tornado or tsunami or some-great-Earthly-crisis of Team 8, there was no time to officially put her on a sub-team, but the treasurer decided that that was fine and worked odd-jobs where she was needed. The matter of which sub-team the treasurer belongs to is still a mystery, a migraine-inducing topic, and another story. Near the end of build season, the previous treasurer, now design captain, Lydia, who was looking for a minion to succeed her, spotted the current treasurer and decided that she had found her minion. The treasurer also has a name Madeline.
