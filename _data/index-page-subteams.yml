  paragraph: Good design is key to developing a successful robot, and this is the job of the Design Team. Design Team leads the team
        in prototyping, allowing different mechanisms and ideas to be built and tested out. After determining which prototypes
        work the best, Design Team creates a computer-aided design (CAD) of the robot before it is built.
Build:

  paragraph: The Build Team is in charge of — you guessed it — building the robot!  The Build Team takes a design and makes it a reality,
        thanks to Team 8's plethora of tools, including a lathe, CNC mill, laser cutter and 3D printer. In addition to machining,
        Build Team members learn about topics such as robot wiring and pneumatics systems, bringing all of this knowledge to
        help create the final product.
Software:

  paragraph: Writing code in Java and Python, the Software Team works alongside Build Team to test our robot and make it functional. In addition to autonomous and human control of the robot, they code features such as computer vision, and a dashboard to display the robot status during matches. We collaborate using Git, and publish our projects here&#58; <a href="https://github.com/team8" target="_blank" class="paragraph-links">www.github.com/team8</a>.

  paragraph: What does art have to do with robotics, you may ask&#63; Well, in addition to hosting the classic regional and national robotics
        competitions, FIRST also holds an annual animation contest! Our Art Team works together to create short videos for this
        competition using Autodesk 3D animation software. Art Team also designs our t-shirts, posters, flyers, banners, logos,
        buttons and anything else you can think of!
