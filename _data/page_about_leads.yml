  bio: The treasurer joined Paly Robotics her freshman year, during the middle of build season. As she was swept into the tornado or tsunami or some-great-Earthly-crisis of Team 8, there was no time to officially put her on a sub-team, but the treasurer decided that that was fine and worked odd-jobs where she was needed. The matter of which sub-team the treasurer belongs to is still a mystery, a migraine-inducing topic, and another story. Near the end of build season, the previous treasurer, now design captain, Lydia, who was looking for a minion to succeed her, spotted the current treasurer and decided that she had found her minion. The treasurer also has a name Madeline.

  bio: The Lab Manager of Team 8 is in charge of organizing the lab, keeping it clean, and monitoring the use of the machines. The Lab Manager should also know where everything is in the lab. In addition to the Lab Manager's usual tasks, Team 8 has "Lab Clean-Up" days (aka "Doughnut" days) where the whole team completely cleans the lab under the direction of the Lab Manager.
