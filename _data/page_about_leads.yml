When not holding serious meetings at Tin Pot or Kirk’s with the Art Team Leadership, she spends her time doing odd-jobs for Paly Theatre and her APUSH homework. And yes, it is very funny that her name is Maya and the Art Team uses Autodesk Maya. In fact, it's so funny that you should definitely make that joke to her face for the 9,999th time, because it hasn’t gotten old by now at all. Ha. Ha. Ha.
