  ROLE: Art Captain

  name: Maya Chin
  email: mchin [at] palyrobotics [dot] com
  bio: Maya is a junior who joined Paly Robotics her freshman year as an animator and storyboard artist under Griffin Bajor (the founder of Art Team and first Art Captain), eventually becoming the Art Project Manager to Peter Turnbull (the second Art Captain), before having to take up the mantle of Art Captain herself when both her predecessors were brutally murdered. When not holding serious meetings at Tin Pot or Kirk’s with the Art Team Leadership (Animation Lead Charlie, Graphic Design Lead Isabella, Sketching & Storytelling Lead Annie, Photography Lead Annalee and Kohai Ben), she spends her time doing odd-jobs for Paly Theatre and her APUSH homework. And yes, it is very funny that her name is Maya and the Art Team uses Autodesk Maya. In fact, it's so funny that you should definitely make that joke to her face for the 9,999th time, because it hasn’t gotten old by now at all. Ha. Ha. Ha.

  bio: Shota Yamamoto is a junior on Team 8 and has been on the team since his sophomore year. He was originally on business team, but realized that his true passion was being more hands on with the robot. While on business, Shota helped find sponsors, and his hard work helped find the team food sponsors for build season. In addition, he was the lead for the Spirit and Stanford Concessions committees. As the year progressed, he found himself helping and organizing scouting and strategy at competitions, cage reorganization in the offseason and the PALY Robotics summer camp. Hoping to make a difference on Team 8, he delved into all work he was given, and is the reason he is our lab manager this year.
