Frequently attending leadership meetings despite her inexperience, she soon became the epicentre of funding and public relations between Team 8 and countless businesses around the community.

  email: lbrownell [at] palyrobotics [dot] com
  bio: Lydia Brownell is a sophomore and has been on the team about two years. She began as a build team member, and still actively participates in the build team, but has expanded into the newly created role of design captain. She loves being on Team 8 because she has built model cars and planes since she was 8 years old and tinkered with legos even earlier than that; robotics is the next step. Robotics has also taught her very useful leadership skills, as well as given her many awesome friends who also care just as much about robotics and the traditions of Paly Robotics. Outside of Robotics, Lydia loves to read, build and draw miniature models, and hang out with her friends and family.

He now serves as the Art Captain and Animation Lead, and helps out with a handful of additional projects. When he absolutely can.t be in the lab (i.e. when the coach makes everyone go home), he.s probably on Slack or tinkering with several small art/computer science/engineering projects that are in various stages of completion.

  role: Web Captain

  name: Alex Tarng
  email: atarng [at] palyrobotics [dot] com
  bio: When Alex Tarng joined robotics, he wasn't sure what team to join, as every job was something that he loved doing. So, of course, he joined Web. Max Bernstein taught him, along with his few peers, the way of Jekyll and Unix, and explored the more hidden parts of Git. Over time all of them progress to be where they are now, until Rafi Long was the only one still on web team. Rafi became captain in 2014, but left his position to join Team 6036 at the end of 2015. Alex, who was the only person left on the team who knew enough about the website, took over as web captain. He is now working to tie together all the loose ends and trying to seal the hole Rafi left in the team.

  role: Treasurer

  name: Madeline Li
  email: mli [at] palyrobotics [dot] com
  bio: The treasurer joined Paly Robotics her freshman year, during the middle of build season. As she was swept into the tornado or tsunami or some-great-Earthly-crisis of Team 8, there was no time to officially put her on a sub-team, but the treasurer decided that that was fine and worked odd-jobs where she was needed. The matter of which sub-team the treasurer belongs to is still a mystery, a migraine-inducing topic, and another story. Near the end of build season, the previous treasurer, now design captain, Lydia, who was looking for a minion to succeed her, spotted the current treasurer and decided that she had found her minion. The treasurer also has a name Madeline.
